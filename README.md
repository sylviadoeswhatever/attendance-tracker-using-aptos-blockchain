# Live Class RSVP Tool

## Description of the Project

The Live Class RSVP Tool is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables teachers and educational institutions to efficiently manage class attendance through a transparent RSVP system. The contract allows teachers to create live class sessions with specific capacity limits, while students can reserve their spots in advance through blockchain-verified RSVPs.

The system prevents double bookings and overbooking by maintaining an immutable record of all student RSVPs on the blockchain. Each class session includes essential details such as class name, scheduled time, maximum capacity, and a comprehensive list of registered attendees. This creates a reliable, tamper-proof attendance tracking mechanism that benefits both educators and students.

Key features include:
- **Decentralized Class Management**: Teachers can create and manage live classes directly on the blockchain
- **Smart RSVP System**: Students can reserve spots with automatic duplicate and capacity checks
- **Transparent Attendance**: All RSVPs are publicly verifiable on the Aptos blockchain
- **Capacity Control**: Built-in mechanisms prevent class overcrowding

## Vision of the Project

Our vision is to revolutionize educational attendance management by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and trustless system for class RSVPs. We aim to eliminate traditional attendance issues such as ghost bookings, manual tracking errors, and disputes over class participation.

The Live Class RSVP Tool envisions a future where:
- **Educational institutions** can seamlessly manage class capacities and student engagement
- **Students** have guaranteed, verifiable proof of their class participation and commitment
- **Transparency** in educational processes builds trust between institutions and learners
- **Decentralized education** becomes more accessible and efficiently managed globally

By building on the Aptos blockchain, we ensure fast, low-cost transactions that make this system practical for daily educational use while maintaining the security and immutability that blockchain technology provides.

## Future Scope of the Project

The Live Class RSVP Tool represents the foundation for a comprehensive decentralized education management ecosystem. Future enhancements and expansions include:

### Short-term Enhancements (3-6 months)
